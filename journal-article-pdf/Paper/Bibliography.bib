  abstract = {Whole building energy simulation (BES) models play a significant role in the design and optimisation of buildings. Simulation models may be used to compare the cost-effectiveness of energy-conservation measures (ECMs) in the design stage as well as assessing various performance optimisation measures during the operational stage. However, due to the complexity of the built environment and prevalence of large numbers of independent interacting variables, it is difficult to achieve an accurate representation of real-world building operation. Therefore, by reconciling model outputs with measured data, we can achieve more accurate and reliable results. This reconciliation of model outputs with measured data is known as calibration. This paper presents a detailed review of current approaches to model development and calibration, highlighting the importance of uncertainty in the calibration process. This is accompanied by a detailed assessment of the various analytical and mathematical/statistical tools employed by practitioners to date, as well as a discussion on both the problems and the merits of the presented approaches.},

  abstract = {The effects of air movement from ceiling fans on subjective thermal comfort and perceived air quality (PAQ) were examined for warm-humid environments. In a climate chamber controlled at three temperatures (26~$^\circ$C, 28~$^\circ$C and 30~$^\circ$C) and two relative humidity (RH 60\% and 80\%), sixteen subjects (8 males and 8 females) dressed in summer clothing (0.5 clo) were exposed to 7 levels of air speed ranging from 0.05~m/s to 1.8~m/s. The subjects were asked to rate their thermal sensation, comfort, PAQ, air movement acceptability, humidity sensation, eye-dryness during the 2-h~and 15~min long tests. Air movement significantly improves the subjects' thermal comfort, PAQ, and humidity sensation without causing dry-eye discomfort. Without air movement, the 80\% acceptable limit established by the ASHRAE standard 55 was reached at 26$^\circ$C/60\%RH, 26$^\circ$C/80\%RH, and 28$^\circ$C/60\%RH. With air movement, more than 80\% of the subjects perceived the environments acceptable at 28$^\circ$C/80\%RH, 30$^\circ$C/60\%RH, and 30$^\circ$C/80\%RH. The preferred air speeds for ceiling fans were in many cases higher than the limit specified in ASHRAE Standard, which is 0.8~m/s when users have no control over the fan.},

  doi = {10.1080/14640747408400404},
  abstract = {The subjects were presented with active and passive sentences. For each sentence, they had to choose between two alternative implications. The pattern of choices indicates that in the passive the logical subject was interpreted by the subjects as the focal point of the information asserted by the sentence and as the carrier of overall responsibility for the sentential proposition. In contrast to the passive, there was no clear pattern of preferences for the active. The difference between the two voices was attributed to their markedness asymmetry, the passive being marked and the active unmarked. It is concluded that the active offers a neutral structure for conveying information; a structure available for use when one does not want to superimpose on the information content any stylistic or connotational implications. The passive, on the other hand, suggests special connotations in addition to the basic message.},
