# Abstract {.unnumbered}
The above heading doesn't count towards heading numbers. Handy for abstracts, nomenclature, etc. If you want to change the style and formatting of any of the headings you can do so by modifying the Styles in the word template references above, 'template.docx'.

# First level heading
Here's how you cite a reference [@rafteryQuantifyingEnergyLosses2018]. It must be in the bibliography file 'references.bib', which is in the bibtex file format and can be automatically output by a citation management software. For example, Zotero.

## Second level heading
You can and should perform any short calculations directly in the text. For example, there are `r nrow(iris)` rows in the Iris dataset. The mean  species length is `r mean(iris$Sepal.Length)`. Anything more substantial should be calculated (and well commented) in a separate code chunk.
```{r}
# you'll often need to perform calculations that require multiple lines of code and should be commented
# you can do these in a separate code chunk like this one
# any variables you define here can be used in any subsequent point in the doc
# that applies both to other chunks 

weird_iris = iris # create a version of the iris dataset with some random noise added to one of the results columns 
weird_iris$Sepal.Length = weird_iris$Sepal.Length*rnorm(nrow(weird_iris), mean=1, sd= 0.1) # add a multiplier of random noise of 0.1 standard deviation
```
The mean species length of the modified iris dataset is `r mean(weird_iris$Sepal.Length)`.

### Third level heading
Here's how you cross reference figure \@ref(fig:yourfignamehere) and here's how you include a footnote 

[^FootnoteTitle]: Your footnote text.

```{r yourfignamehere, fig.cap="Your fig caption here", fig.width=6.5, fig.height=8.5}
# note that your fig name should only use letters as there are sometimes hard to debug issues that happen when you use symbols
# 
# note that you should define the width and height in inches of your figure to fit and be legible on the template page type 
# (default is letter size, which means a max width of 6.5 inches, and a max length of ~8.5inches depending on caption size)
# 
p1 = ggplot(iris, aes(x= Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, color=Species)) + geom_point()

p2 = ggplot(weird_iris, aes(x= Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, color=Species)) + geom_point()

# you can just directly ouput a plot or multiple plots from this code chunk. however,
# often if you have more than one it's best to decide on how you want them organized, 
# add tags so you can refer to sub plots in the text, etc. see below
p1 / p2 + plot_layout(nrow = 2) +
   plot_annotation(tag_levels = c('a'), tag_suffix = ')') & 
   theme(plot.tag.position = c(0, 1),
        plot.tag = element_text(color="darkred"))
```
