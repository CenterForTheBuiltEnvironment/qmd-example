This repository contains a demonstration of how to use R and Quarto to write a paper and render it into an output file. This includes minimal examples of how to manage package installation, cite references, make visualizations, use markdown language, style the output doc, etc. It also includes a mostly blank template to start a new paper from. The first included example focuses on a journal paper submission, and the output is a Word file to facilitate other authors' review and editing processes.

Prerequisites: R, RStudio.

To use it, download all the files into a folder. Open the R Project (example.Rproj) file. Open the Quarto (example.qmd) file within Rstudio. Click 'Render' to run all of the code and create the output file.
